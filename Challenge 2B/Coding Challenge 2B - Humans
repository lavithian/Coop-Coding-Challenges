Human Unit List

Sir Wizards of 42 Tower.
This is the Unit list of our forces.
I hope it is of help.

Spearman
Cost: 100G
Special Ability:
\tSince Spearmen have sharp, long sticks they deal damage to all melee units, except for Trolls, before the opponent gets to retaliate.
\ti.e. When calculating damage, Spearman deals ATK, the opponent receives damage then recalculates their ATK before dealing their ATK.
Comment:
Remember to aim the pointy end to the enemy. No, you don't need to check if it's actually pointy.

Archers
Cost: 150G
Special Ability: 
As long as there are equal or more number of Spearmen than Archers, Archers will not receive any damage from melee attacks. 
They deal double ATK to airborn units.
Comment:
Despite their sobriety, they actually love to dance.

Clerics
Cost: 200G
Special Ability:
Description: They can heal their allies. The healing is done after everyone has stabbed or shot at each other though. They can't be targetted by melee attacks as long as there are more Spearman after they are protecting archers. (i.e. if the number of Spearman - Archers > Clerics).
Comment:
They wear funny hats. Apparently it increases their healing prowess or something.

Knights
Cost: 300G
Special Ability:
They have two sets of HP - One for the horse and one for the rider.
When the horse dies, the Knight turns into a Spearman.
They deals double damage when attacking Goblins.
Comment:
I heard one of them had to make a choice between her wife and the horse. She's divorced now.

Peagus riders
Cost: 300G
Special Ability:
They can be programmed with a logic to ignore the Target Priority and attack anything.
Unlike the Knights, they only have one HP as the riders usually don't survive the fall.
Comment:
Runs like a horse. Flies like a pidgeon. Parachutes not included.
