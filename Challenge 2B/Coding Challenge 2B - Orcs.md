# Orc Unit List

_Sir Wizards of 42 Tower._

_Our scouts have compiled a list of Orc Units._

_I hope it is of help._

### **Goblin**

**Special Ability:**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;None. ☹️

**Comment:**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_Ugly as a crushed pumpkin, has terrible breath but can play the violin beautifully._

### **Orcs**

**Special Ability:**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Orcs carry a spare axe which they throw once as a Ranged ATK.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Orcs regain a throwing axe for each defeated Human unit in that round.

**Comment:**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_Remember, they are ORCS, not OGRES! They don't live in swamps. They live in... actually, I don't know where they live._

### **Wargs**

**Special Ability:**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wargs Riders carry crossbows and thus Wargs attack twice: A Ranged ATK followed by a Melee ATK.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When attacking Archers, they attack twice again, for a total of four times (2 Ranged ATKs then 2 Melee ATKs)

**Comment:**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_Despite their evil nature, Wargs are adorable once you get to know them._

### **Trolls**

**Special Ability:**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of their brute size, Trolls always attacks first.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i.e. When calculating damage, Trolls deals ATK, the opponent receives damage then recalculates their ATK before dealing their ATK.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trolls also have thick skin, meaning they only receive half damage from Melee ATKs, rounded down.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i.e. A 3 Melee ATK on a Troll, but the Troll will only receive 1 Damage 

**Comment:**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_Never make a Troll dance. Never._

### **Wyverns**

**Special Ability:**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wyverns are airborn while flying.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wyverns shoot fireballs down from the sky as a Ranged ATK.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every few rounds, Wyverns must land and deal Melee ATK for one round before flying again.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When grounded, Wyverns have the same Special Ability as Trolls.

**Comment:**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_Contrary to popular belief, Wyverns don't make delicious supper. They keep burning down the kitchen._
