# Human Unit List

_Sir Wizards of 42 Tower._

_This is the Unit list of our forces._

_I hope it is of help._

### **Spearman**

**Cost:** 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;100G

**Special Ability:**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since Spearmen have sharp, long sticks they deal damage to all melee units, except for Trolls, before the opponent gets to retaliate.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i.e. When calculating damage, Spearman deals ATK, the opponent receives damage then recalculates their ATK before dealing their ATK.

**Comment:**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_Remember to aim the pointy end to the enemy. No, you don't need to check if it's actually pointy._

### **Archers**

**Cost:**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;150G

**Special Ability:** 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as there are equal or more number of Spearmen than Archers, Archers will not receive any damage from melee attacks. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They deal double ATK to airborn units.

**Comment:**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_Despite their sobriety, they actually love to dance._

### **Clerics**

**Cost:**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;200G

**Special Ability:**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They can heal other units.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They can't heal animals (i.e. Knights' horses and Pegasus) 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as there are more Spearmen after protecting Archers than Clerics, Clerics can't be targetted by Melee ATK. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i.e. If (num of Spearmen - num of Archers) > num of Clerics) 

**Comment:**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_They wear funny hats. Apparently it increases their healing prowess or something._

### **Knights**

**Cost:**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;300G

**Special Ability:**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have two sets of HP - One for the horse and one for the rider.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the horse dies, the Knight turns into a Spearman.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They deals double damage when attacking Goblins.

**Comment:**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_I heard one of them had to make a choice between her wife and her horse. She's divorced now._

### **Peagus Riders**

**Cost:**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;300G

**Special Ability:**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They can be programmed with a logic to ignore the Target Priority and attack anything.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike the Knights, they only have one HP as the riders usually don't survive the fall.

**Comment:**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_Runs like a horse. Flies like a pidgeon. Parachutes not included._
