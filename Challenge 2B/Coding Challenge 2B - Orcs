Orc Unit List

Sir Wizards of 42 Tower.
Our scouts have compiled a list of Orc Units.
I hope it is of help.

Goblin
Special Ability:
None.
Comment:
Ugly as a crushed pumpkin, has terrible breath but can play the violin beautifully. 

Orcs
Special Ability:
Orcs carry a spare axe which they throw once as a Ranged ATK.
Orcs regain a throwing axe for each defeated Human unit.
Comment:
No one knows whence they come from, or how they reproduce. They just appeared.

Wargs
Special Ability:
Wargs Riders carry crossbows and thus Wargs attack twice: A Ranged ATK followed by a Melee ATK.
When attacking Archers, they attack twice again, for a total of four times (2 Ranged ATKs then 2 Melee ATKs)
Comment:
Despite their evil nature, Wargs are adorable once you get to know them.

Trolls
Special Ability:
Because of their brute size, Trolls always attacks first.
i.e. When calculating damage, Trolls deals ATK, the opponent receives damage then recalculates their ATK before dealing their ATK.
Trolls also have thick skin, meaning they only receive half damage from Melee ATKs, rounded down.
i.e. A 3 Melee ATK on a Troll, but the Troll will only receive 1 Damage 
Description: Big burly creatures that carries a large club. Because of their size, they are targetted by all ground troops first. However, because of their enormous size, they can also attack before everyone else, including the spearman. They can also throw rocks to deal ranaged damage.
Comment:
Never make a Troll dance. Never.

Wyverns
Special Ability:
Wyverns are airborn.
Wyverns shoot fireballs down from the sky as a Ranged ATK.
Every few rounds, Wyverns must land and deal Melee ATK for one round before flying again.
When grounded, Wyverns have the same Special Ability as Trolls.
Description: The king of the skies. They can fly around and spit out fire, a ranged attack. They have to land every few turns to do their wyvern thing though, making them vulnerable to ground troops. Otherwise, they are peppered by arrows and poked by Peagusus Riders.
Comment:
Contrary to popular belief, Wyverns don't make delicious supper. They keep burning down the kitchen.
