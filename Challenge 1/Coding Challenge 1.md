Fizz Buzz Jazz Enhanced

Write a program that displays all digits to n while adhering to the following rules:

Fizz = 3
Buzz = the next prime number of F
Jazz = The difference of Fizz and Buzz - THIS IS A TERRIBLE IDEA

For every 10 numbers, Fizz += 1 and a new line.
However, when it reaches a square number, it square roots itself before adding 1. It doesn't doesnt square root itself until the next square number,
e.g. if Fizz is 4, it square roots itself then adds 1 making it 3, then it won't square root itself again until 9 

it shouldn't display any more letters than the amount of digits

ie 12 fi 13 14 bu

if it is both it should have the initials

fibuja

the order of importance when displaying is f -> b -> j

if the amount of numbers are longer than the string, it should fill the space with z

12334 fizzz 22234
