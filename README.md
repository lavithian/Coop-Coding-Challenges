# **Hello and welcome to _Mentor Coding Challenges_!**

There are 3 (three) challenges for you to complete. Please don't try to finish all of them.

These challenges would take a good chunk of time so delegating tasks is fairly important.

## **Challenge 1**

A familiar puzzle for your team to solve. 🫧
Please complete this one first.
Also, please try not to use ChatGPT for this one.

Then please pick one of the two Challenges

## **Challenge 2A**

## **Challenge 2B**

This one involves some maths and logic. You will be making a calculator. ⚔️

If you have somehow finished Challenge 2 in time, then you can either go home or, if curious, tackle Challenge 3:

## **Challenge 3**
