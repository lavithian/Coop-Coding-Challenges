**Please do either _Challenge 2A_ or _Challenge 2B_ but not both (unless you wanna).**

A client wants a website for their pizza takeaway restaurant. Its hook is that all the pizzas are custom designed by the customer.
You need to make a single webpage where the user can customise their pizza.

### **_User Stories:_**
- [ ] As a user, I want to select a sauce base for my pizza.
- [ ] As a user, I want to select what toppings to put on my pizza.
- [ ] As a user, I want to select how many of each toppings to put on my pizza.
- [ ] As a user, I want to see where my toppings will be on the pizza.
- [ ] As a user, I want to select how many slices I want my pizza to be cut into (even numbers only).
- [ ] As a user, I want to see where the cuts will be made so that I know my number of desired slices have been registered.
- [ ] As a user, I want the toppings to be equally distributed on the pizza so that I can lament how organised the pizza is, unlike my life.
- [ ] As a user, I want to know how much of an ingredient is on per slice of pizza so that I can see which slices I can give to my dogs.

### **_BONUSES:_**
- [ ] As a user, I want to cut the pizza at certain places so that I can make a star shaped pizza and throw it at people.
- [ ] As a user, I want to decide the size of the pizza so that I can tell everyone I can control my eating habits, depite being a lie.
- [ ] As a user, I want to place the selected topping directly onto the pizza itself so that pineapple pizza lovers and anti-pineapple pizza lovers can live harmonously.
